# Data 

- Table 2 was retrieved on 2/26/20 from the Methods section of the paper. The entire table was copied and pasted into an Excel sheet which was then saved as .csv file. This file was then pushed to the data remote repository with the commit message of "known FC and predicted FC data".   

- All supplmentary tables were retrieved from the online version of the paper, https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jwmg.318. 

- Supplmentary tables 1,3,4,5,6 were retrieved on 2/26/20. For each supplmentary table file, the table was copied in it's entirety, including the the legend and literature cited, and pasted into an Excel sheet which was then saved as .csv file. Each file was pushed separately to the data remote repository with a commit message indicting the type of data in the file.

- Supplmentary table 7 was retrieved on 2/27/20. It was copied in its entirety and pasted into an Excel sheet which was then saved as a .csv file. When converted in a .csv file, the column probability of FC was shifted and had to manually corrected. The file was pushed to the data remote reository with the commit message of "126 predicted NFC data". 

- Note: As seen with Supplmentary table 7, columns or rows could be shifted when converting the file type. It is important to check the file after conversion to ensure the data lines up properly.

- 2 files for IsotopeR were uploaded on 4/3/2020. These files are the necessary files to run IsotopeR for it to estimate the mixing space. Other files are optional. For this project two more files (Concentrations and Discrimation Error) will be added at a later time as the data continues to be organized and prepared for upload to IsotopeR.
