Supplemental Table 6. Human food digestibility calculations for humans in the United States. Three foods (minimum) were selected from each dietary source category provided by Nakamaru et al. (1982). Stoichiometric measurements were recorded for each food (located by entering each food’s NDB# [Nutrient databank identifier] into the NDB search field at http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/). Digest [C] and Digest [N] are calculated using the formulas below. Mean [C] and [N] are calculated for each source category and weighed according to the weighting factors; in parentheses next to each dietary source category (Nakamaru et al. 1982). Weight [C] and [N] (and 1 SD) represent the estimated weighted [C] and [N] for human food in the United States. These parameters are fixed and used to estimate proportional dietary source contributions in all models that use such parameters. Data also published as on-line material in Hopkins and Ferguson (2011; in Press).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
