Supplemental Table 4. Macronutrient composition of bear foods calculated from the USDA National Nutrient Database. Quercus spp. (acorns) and Pinus spp. (pinenuts) were collected in Yosemite National Park in 2007. Stoichiometric measurements were recorded for each food (A) and dry weight was calculated (B). Digestible [C] and [N] was calculated using the equations above Table C.,,,,,,,,

Factors for calculating macronutrient dry weight from Robbins (1993) unless specified,,,,,,,,
Protein [N] = Protein (% dry weight) x 0.16,,,,,,,,
Digest [N] = Protein N * 0.466 (digestibility of pinenuts; used for acorns) from Mealey (1980),,,,,,,,
Protein [C] = Protein (% dry weight) x 0.52,,,,,,,,
Digest Protein [C] = Protein C x 0.466 (Mealey 1980),,,,,,,,
Lipid [C] = Lipid (% dry weight) x 0.75,,,,,,,,
Carbo [C] = Carbohydrate (% dry weight) x 0.45,,,,,,,,
Digest [C] = Digest Protein [C] + Lipid [C] + Carbo [C],,,,,,,,
