# Data organization 

## Goal 
The data found in the supplmentary files and Table 2 need to be organized into 4 files: Mixtures, Sources, Concentrations and Discrimination error. 

1. All data files are found in the `/data` folder 
2. Manually transfer the necessary data to a new .csv file
3. Upload the data files to IsotopeR. Check out the `/script` folder for parameters used in IsotopeR 

Note: When manually transferring the data into a new file, use the example data files found at http://jackhopkinswildlife.com/isotoper/. These are already formatted correctly. The user can clear the example data and type in their own data and click save. The file name will then be "copy of ..." as seen in the above files. 

## Where to find the data for each file 

- Mixtures file: Table 2
- Sources file: Supplmentary tables 1 and 7
- Concentrations file: Supplmentary tables 3,4 and 6
- Discrimation error file: Supplmentary tables 3,4 and 6 

## 4/17/20 update 
The Discrimination error file is no longer needed for this project. I contacted the author of the paper and he explained they already included the discrimination error to the isotopic values for both the Mixtures and Sources.
