# Data organization 

## Goal 
The data found in the supplmentary files and Table 2 need to be organized into 4 files: Mixtures, Sources, Concentrations and Discrimination error. 

1. All data files are found in the `/data` folder 
2. Manually transfer the necessary data to a new .csv file
3. Upload the data files to IsotopeR. Check out the `/script` folder for parameters used in IsotopeR 

## Where to find the data for each file 

- Mixtures file: Table 2
- Sources file: Supplmentary tables 1 and 7
- Concentrations file: Supplmentary tables 3,4 and 6
- Discrimation error file: Supplmentary tables 3,4 and 6 

## 4/17/20 update 
The Discrimination error file is no longer needed for this project. I contacted the author of the paper and he explained they already included the discrimination error to the isotopic values for both the Mixtures and Sources.
