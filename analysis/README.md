# Data organization 

## Goal 
The data found in the supplmentary files need to be organized into 4 files: Mixtures, Sources, Concentrations and Discrimination error. 

1. Supplmentary files are found in the '/data' folder 
2. Manually transfer the necessary data to a new .csv file 
3. Upload the data files to IsotopeR. Check out the '/script' for parameters used in IsotopeR 


# 4/17/20 update 
The Discrimination error file is no longer needed for this project. I contacted the author of the paper and he explained they included the discrimination error to the isotopic values
