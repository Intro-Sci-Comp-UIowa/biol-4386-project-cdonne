The following 2 images are from my first run of IsotopeR. The first plot is the raw values of the consumers(grey) and sources(blue and red). This looks like a good start. 
The second plot is the estimated mixing space. This does not look like the orginal Figure 5. The bottom mixing space looks correct but the top mixing space looks too big. I have to revist the data and make sure I have entered the values correct for that source
