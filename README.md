# Stable isotopes to detect food-conditioned bears and to evalute human-bear managment 
In this study Hopkins et al. used stable isotope analysis along with genetic anaylis of black bears in Yosemite National Park. The purpose of this paper was to idenitfy which bears were food-conditioned and which bears were not and then to use this information to evalute the success of the fairly recent bear management program.
