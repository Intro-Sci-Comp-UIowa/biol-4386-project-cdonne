# Stable isotopes to detect food-conditioned bears and to evalute human-bear managment 
In this study Hopkins et al. used stable isotope analysis along with genetic analysis of black bears in Yosemite National Park to determine whether bears were food-conditioned to human food or nonfood-conditioned. This information helped evalute the success of a bear management program that was implemented to lessen bear incidents with campers.

Figure 5. Isotopic mixing space used to estimate the diets of known and predicted food-conditioned (FC) bears sampled in Yosemite National Park, California, USA,2001-2007. IsotopeR estimated the isotopic distribution (mean and 2 SD) of each dietary source (100% plants and animals, and 100% human food) and estimated the proportional dietary contributions for the population and each individual bear. IsotopeR estimated measurment error but error bars for bears are not included in the figure.
