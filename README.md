# Stable isotopes to detect food-conditioned bears and to evalute human-bear managment 
In this study Hopkins et al. used stable isotope analysis along with genetic anaylis of black bears in Yosemite National Park. The purpose of this paper was to idenitfy which bears were food-conditioned and which bears were not and then to use this information to evalute the success of the fairly recent bear management program.

### Figure 
I am going to reproduce figure 4 in the paper. This figure shows the probability that known and unknown bears are food-conditioned based on their nitrogen isotope value. 

#### Data avaliabilty  
All the data is published in supplementary tables or figures on the online version of the article.
