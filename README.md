# Stable isotopes to detect food-conditioned bears and to evalute human-bear managment 
In this study Hopkins et al. used stable isotope analysis along with genetic analysis of black bears in Yosemite National Park to determine whether bears were food-conditioned to human food or nonfood-conditioned. This information helped evalute the success of a bear management program that was implemented to lessen bear incidents with campers.
